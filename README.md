# STAT 460 Bayesian-Statistics


## Calendar description

The Bayesian approach to statistics is an alternative and increasingly popular way of quantifying uncertainty in the presence of data. This course considers comparative statistical inference, prior distributions, Bayesian computation, and applications.

## Course outline

### 1. The basics:
      
      the Bayesian paradigm
      
      comparative statistical inference
      
### 2. Priors:

      prior elicitation
      reference priors
      improper priors
      discrete mass priors
3. Computations:
      quadrature
      importance sampling
      Markov chain Monte Carlo
4. Other topics as time permits: 
      testing via Bayes factors
